// WIDENED COVERAGE (COMPUTEPROOF-TEST-COVERAGE-1, 2026-08-13). Everything above verifies ONE exemplar
// (art-04). Two independent rows flagged that as a real gap — S18-RATCHET-ETHMATH-0811-1: "compute-proof
// .test.mjs pins a single art-04 exemplar and does NOT cover these receipts"; ART607-GUEST-ERROR-1 confirmed
// it again. This estate has separately shipped a valid groth16 seal over an ERROR journal (art-529,
// historical — see check-compute-proof-coverage.mjs's classifyNode() comment) and 20 proofs that once
// verified while attesting NOTHING (the async-vacuous class, ASYNC-VACUOUS-REMEDIATE-1). A green proof is
// evidence about the ONE INPUT it ran, never about the kernel — the suite passing was a statement about
// art-04 and nothing else.
//
// COVERAGE POLICY — a NAMED REPRESENTATIVE SET, not every receipt in the graph (stated, not silent).
// verifySeal() does a real BN254 pairing check, measured ~60-85ms/call; at 581 currently-proven gpu:false
// live receipts that is 35-50s+ of real crypto, run on every `preflight.mjs --changed origin/main` pre-push
// — the exact floor SO explicitly protects (cut from 5m 7.7s to 0.49s by a DIFFERENT gate's scoping; see
// this row's check-off for measured before/after timings here). The full-estate non-vacuity/recompute
// question is already owned, full-estate, by scripts/check-recompute-equality.mjs (SO #34,
// ASYNC-VACUOUS-GATE-1, ~8s, wired into preflight.mjs + CI) — it re-executes every proven node's kernel in
// a sandbox and requires journal.output to reproduce, but it never touches the cryptographic seal. This
// suite's unique job is the seal + binding + independent-digest chain that recompute-equality never
// exercises, so a fast representative set is the right shape here rather than re-running that gate's
// full-estate sweep a second time under a slower crypto path.
//
// SELECTION RULE (written down — the async-vacuous class survived exactly BECAUSE sampling was silent):
//   - art-04  (above) — the one BESPOKE-image exemplar (Rust-ported guest, not the universal QuickJS
//     runner) — exercises the non-universal-imageId path. Kept from the original suite.
//   - art-01  — a UNIVERSAL guest image (sha256:a1a0bc89…) exemplar. That image covers 573 of 581 live
//     proven receipts, so at least one is required for this suite to say anything about most of them.
//   - art-189 — a CONVERTED-CRYPTO node: one of the kernels ASYNC-VACUOUS-REMEDIATE-1 converted from async
//     to sync via an inlined pure-JS SHA-256 (art-476's inlining pattern), and one that genuinely computes
//     SHA-256 digests inside compute() — "crypto" on both the conversion mechanism and the kernel's own
//     logic.
//   - art-201, art-371 — the two other BESPOKE-image survivor-set nodes (RIDER-KERNEL.md's
//     `{art-04, art-201, art-371, art-413/414/415}`), each under a distinct imageId from art-04's.
//   - art-529 — the exact node check-compute-proof-coverage.mjs's classifyNode() names as the historical
//     instance of a REAL verifying seal over an ERROR journal (CCPCORE-PROVE-1). It is proven and
//     non-error today; included to prove the CURRENT receipt clears every check this suite runs, not
//     merely that the class was fixed elsewhere. It is also a §25 ocg-private-input@1 kernel, so — unlike
//     the other four — its journal cannot be cross-checked against a published fixture vector by
//     construction (its real input is a private witness); that one leg is skipped for it, stated inline,
//     matching check-recompute-equality.mjs's own pre-existing §25 exclusion.
//   - the DEFERRED exemplars are DERIVED from the graph, not pinned by name (see the deferred block at the
//     bottom of this file for why art-607 stopped being that pin). This suite asserts the deferred path
//     classifies honestly — never silently read as proven.
//
// Every receipt is read from chaingraph.json (the Graph Index — the same place a real consumer reads it
// from) or the kernel's own dedicated fixture file, never re-derived or invented. kernel_digest is
// independently recomputed from the KERNEL SOURCE FILE on disk via _buildid.mjs's sourceDigest() — SO #34:
// never read the digest back out of the artifact under test. journal.output is cross-checked against the
