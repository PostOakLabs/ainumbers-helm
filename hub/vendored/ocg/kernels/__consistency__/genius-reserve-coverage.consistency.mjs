// FAMILY B — stablecoin reserve-coverage family.
//
// SHARED REGULATORY SUBSTANCE. art-06 and art-582 both implement the GENIUS Act
// S.394 §4(a) 1:1 reserve coverage requirement, and both compute the same quantity
// from the same three caller-supplied numbers: outstanding tokens, token price, and
// total reserves. art-512 implements the MiCA analogue of the same arithmetic and is
// included as the family's third voice on the degenerate-input question, because it
// states its treatment of that case explicitly in its own payload rationale.
//
// SELECTION RATIONALE. Enumerated from chaingraph/graph/chains/*.json: the chain
// `mica-register-crosscheck` (art-602 -> art-512 -> art-06 -> art-582) carries two
// independent reserve-coverage implementations plus a third disclosure checker over
// the same substance, and shared six distinct multi-digit constants across its
// kernels. It is the only chain in the estate where two kernels compute the SAME
// ratio from the SAME inputs under two different statutes, which makes the
// cross-kernel relationship unusually sharp: the numbers are not merely related, they
// must be equal.
//
// SCOPE NOTE, stated rather than assumed. art-06 and art-582 apply different statutes
// to the coverage figure and reach different overall determinations for legitimate
// reasons (art-06 folds in asset eligibility and an AICPA attestation score; art-582
// deliberately narrowed its scope to coverage arithmetic and attestation timeliness).
// The properties below therefore assert consistency of THE COVERAGE FINDING ONLY,
// never of the two overall determinations, which are not required to agree.
